## Aeristo Data Migration Plan: Microsoft Dynamics AX to Dynamics 365 Business Central

### 📌 Purpose

This migration plan, designed by an Associate Solutions Architect, outlines a step-by-step, end-to-end ETL and data pipeline solution to transfer \~500,000 records from Microsoft Dynamics AX (pre-2023 legacy data) to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (post-2023 live data). It ensures accurate data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) to support real-time analytics via R Shiny applications in RStudio, as well as Excel and Power BI reporting.

### 🛝 Overview and Assumptions

**Objective**: Migrate \~500,000 records from Dynamics AX (Customer, Sales, Inventory, Vendor, Purchasing, General Ledger, Manufacturing) to Business Central, enabling real-time analytics in RStudio via R Shiny.

**Assumptions:**

* Business Central is cloud-based (Azure SQL Database), with REST/OData V4 APIs for data access.
* Dynamics AX uses SQL Server (on-premises/hosted).
* Azure SQL Database is used as a staging layer.
* Aeristo IT provides schema documentation, credentials, and API keys.
* RStudio is hosted on Azure or internal servers for R Shiny deployment.
* Migration timeline: 4-6 weeks.

**Scope:**

* Full historical data migration (\~500,000 records).
* Incremental daily updates (\~1K-5K records).
* Real-time API connectivity for RStudio reporting.

### 🚀 Migration Process Overview

The migration follows a phased ETL pipeline:

1. **Preparation**: Set up Azure resources, validate access, map schemas.
2. **Extraction**: Pull data from AX using SQL or DMF.
3. **Staging**: Store raw data in Azure SQL.
4. **Transformation**: Align AX data to BC schema using ADF and R.
5. **Loading**: Push transformed data to BC via OData APIs.
6. **Real-Time Updates**: Configure incremental API syncs.
7. **RStudio Integration**: Build R Shiny apps for real-time reporting.
8. **Validation**: Test data integrity and performance.
9. **Monitoring**: Ensure pipeline reliability.

> **Why ADF Matters:** Azure Data Factory is the backbone of this project’s automation. It orchestrates data flow between systems, applying business rules and executing data movements without manual intervention. This dramatically improves speed, reliability, and scalability.

> **Why OData Is Used:** OData lets us pull or push data securely and efficiently into Business Central using well-defined web endpoints. It provides a consistent method for real-time syncing.

> **Why This Matters to Stakeholders:** Each step ensures your business gets clean, accurate, and timely data while minimizing disruption and preserving historical information. This enables better reporting, faster decisions, and reduced technical debt long-term.
